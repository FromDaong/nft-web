## What is the Discover page

Its basically just the TikTok for you page, still really debating on whether to have only the people you are following or should we also include content we think you will love. I mean yeah the latter seems best because we wont have much to filter but when should we allow the user to show only those they follow and how often can we break those rules?

- Use of a recommender algorithm to figure which content to promote to the user. Going to be using a white label finetuned on our dataset with the hopes of creating an in-house algorithm later, might be really worth it. Also use this to populate the featured tabs for user, we want to show a featured user whom you might follow as we have limited space in that tab.
