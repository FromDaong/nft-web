        Some parts of our Site or Service may also require you to pay a fee.
        While our basic site access does not require a fee, you will be limited
        in how you can interact with the Site or the other members of our Site.
        While we may help facilitate transactions between you and a creator of
        Content, we are not a party to the contract and not responsible for
        either of you. Payments are exclusive of taxes and its up to you to pay
        your own. Creators are responsible for pricing and you pay what you pay.
        You agree you will not do anything as a free member that you are not
        allowed to do, which means circumventing any parts of our Site,
        attempting to contact members in a way that would be deceitful or in a
        manner that is intended to circumvent paying the fee.

        We reserve the right to terminate your account at any time. This
        includes but is not limited to, our belief that you have shared or
        assigned your account to any other person or third party. You are not
        authorized to share your account with anyone else, and if we discover

        even legal? Guess we will find out!). We reserve the right to terminate
        your account and delete all of your information at any time if you’re
        being an asshole. The prices of crypto assets are extremely volatile

        rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it
        turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, the term will be
        modified such that it is enforceable and this will not affect any other
